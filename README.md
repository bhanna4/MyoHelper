# MyoHelper
This is a program written using Visual Studio 2012 which allows a user with a Myo armband to control an arrow on the screen with the basic Myo functions. This was created as a proof of concept for a larger idea explained within the readme


##Movement controls
Forward movement: closed fist

Backwards movement: spread fingers

Turn right: wave out

Turn left: wave in


##Notes on Movement
The turns will currently change in intervals of 45 degrees every 40th of a second

The forward and backward motions will change at a speed of 2 pixels every 20th of a second

**Note values are subject to change and may be different if readme not updated after each commit

##Next Steps
Include a function based on the person swinging their arm from pointing directly out from body, elbow at 90 degrees, to swinging it to be directly against their torso that will then open doors within the layout
This ivolves creating a more advanced model, 3D preferably so the door swing motion can be seen clearly.
